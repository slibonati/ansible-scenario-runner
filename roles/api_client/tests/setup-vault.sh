# Create gitignored vault.yml (ansible-vault encrypted) and .vault_pass.
#
# Usage:
#   ./setup-vault.sh              # ensure .vault_pass + encrypt vault.yml
#   ./setup-vault.sh --demo       # write demo password "demo-vault-pass" if missing
#   VAULT_PASS='secret' ./setup-vault.sh
#
# Typical first-time flow:
#   cp vault.example.yml vault.yml   # optional; setup-vault.sh copies if missing
#   # edit vault.yml (plaintext) if needed
#   ./setup-vault.sh
#   ansible-vault edit vault.yml --vault-password-file .vault_pass
